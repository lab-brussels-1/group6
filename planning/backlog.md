Home page

- Concerning images
- As a user I can read that planting a tree has a positive impact on the
  environment.

## Should Haves

  to save the trees.
- NavBar
- The website could improve if we could list all of the companies who are
  already working out there to save the trees.

## Could Haves

- IT would be amazing if we could have a page dedicated to volunteers who would
  like to donate their time to plant and save the trees.

- It would be amazing if we could have a shop online linked to the website so
- visitors could buy products and the money raised would be towards saving the
  trees.
