# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

creating a new branch locally before updating the master/main with git pull
command creating a new branch from different branches (not from main or not from
master)

## Continue Doing

continue with the online video sessions from our coaches working in
collaboration and close coordination within the team (we liked the fact that we
didn't have many issues because we had a good communication.)

## Start Doing

we should try to available to review PRs as soon as a PR is made

## Lessons Learned

Html, css, rebase, git stash, not to use background radiant might cause issue
due to packages properties.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

Collaboration and communication went well

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

### Or remove extra steps?
