# Constrains

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

- Time

  > Time don’t stop for anyone. Time is essential part of project.

- Availability

  > Availability is most important part of project. With everyone’s presence
  > project work will run smoothly.

- Distance

  > All of our team members live far away making it difficult to reunite
  > physically. Server issues: Problems in servers or any remote problems with
  > the platforms we use might cause delay in our deadlines.

- Hand of god
  > Any event that we cannot control like weather, accidents, etc. that might
  > disrupt our workflow therefore, our deadline.

## Internal: Involuntary

- Technology

  > Without Practice technology is our restriction but with Practice you will be
  > perfect in technology.

- Issues

  > In the project issues will occur. But Yes ! We can fix it.

- Interface and/or OS

  > All members of our teams use different OS (Mac, Windows, Linux) making it
  > difficult to have a single work technology to use.

- Troubleshooting
  > Issues we might encounter while working in the workflow due to missuse or
  > mistake of commands or workflow. Can be solved but we need to invest time to
  > investigate.

---

## Internal: Voluntary

- Communication

  > Depends on time and availability if both are solve then communication
  > problem is solved.

- Dependency
  > Team is all about being dependent on each other. Hence we need to work on
  > our own part as soon as possible so we do not create dependency for others.
- Work/life balance
  > We all have other matters to attend besides the project making it difficult
  > to be available at all times, and since we all depend of someone else to
  > review our updates or we also require time to discuss in group what we need,
  > that might complicate our efficiency in time.
