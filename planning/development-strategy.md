## Group Conventions for The Project

- Issues will be named with the same name of the tasks:
  ### Tasks

1. Constraints
2. User-persona
3. Communications
4. Backlog
5. Design
6. Development-strategy
7. Retrospective
8. Main README MD

- PR should be named as 'issue they are linked to + the word PR' (for example
  "3 - backlog file creation PR")

- All files and folders should be named with the lowercase letters. No weird
  characters. Inside of spaces, use '-' (e.g.: user-persona.md)

- An issue will be created with the question template with the error messages
  and the steps you followed to fix it.

- Every PR should be linked to your specific issue and a co-worker should be
  assigned for review.

- Always make sure to keep your local repo updated with git pull origin master
