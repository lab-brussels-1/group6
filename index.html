          Trees are an important part of every community. Since the beginning,
          trees have furnished us with two of life’s essentials, food and
          oxygen. Trees control climate by moderating the effects of the sun,
          rain and wind. Leaves absorb and filter the sun’s radiant energy,
          keeping things cool in summer. Trees also preserve warmth by providing
          a screen from harsh wind. In addition to influencing wind speed and
          direction, they shield us from the downfall of rain, sleet and hail.
          Trees also lower the air temperature and reduce the heat intensity of
          the greenhouse effect by maintaining low levels of carbon dioxide.
