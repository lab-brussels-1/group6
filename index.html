          Trees are an important part of every community. Since the beginning,
          trees have furnished us with two of life’s essentials, food and
          oxygen. Trees control climate by moderating the effects of the sun,
          rain and wind. Leaves absorb and filter the sun’s radiant energy,
          keeping things cool in summer. Trees also preserve warmth by providing
          a screen from harsh wind. In addition to influencing wind speed and
          direction, they shield us from the downfall of rain, sleet and hail.
          Trees also lower the air temperature and reduce the heat intensity of
          the greenhouse effect by maintaining low levels of carbon dioxide.

          Trees are one of the most beautiful plants on our planet. Since the
          beginning, trees have furnished us with two of life’s essentials, food
          and oxygen. As we evolved, they provided additional necessities such
          as shelter, medicine, and tools. Today, their value continues to
          increase and more benefits of trees are being discovered as their role
          expands to satisfy the needs created by our modern lifestyles.Can you
          imagine how many trees surround us, how many benefits they bring to
          us.A study in the journal of ‘Nature’ reported close to 3.04 Trillion
          trees on earth. And though this might seem like a lot- it’s not! 3.04
          Trillion trees make for almost 422 trees per person.The largest forest
          in the world exists far to the north amongst a less bountiful
          ecosystem.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Great Boreal Forests span the Arctic circle in Canada, Russia, and
          Scandinavia. These forests contain approximately 750 billion trees,
          nearly ¼ of the world’s total.Forests are very important to the
          environment because they use carbon dioxide (CO2) and produce oxygen.
          They also provide shelter and food for many different types of plants
          and animals. But we also have negative aspects like cutting down trees
          is called deforestation and it can have serious effects. If animals’
          homes, which are built in and around the trees, are destroyed, many
          species will become extinct. For example, many different types of
          animals in South America were lost before scientists could learn about
          them. Deforestation also affects the climate. When rain falls on a
          forest, new clouds are created. If huge areas of trees are cut down,
          clouds do not form, rain does not fall and the land becomes drier. The
          CO2 builds up and adds to the global warming which is making the Earth
          become hotter. Many European countries are planting trees faster than
          they are cutting them down. Many trees were planted a few years ago to
          replace woodland and to create forests in areas where there wasn’t
          much wood. Have you thought about what we can do to make our forests
          and parks even more beautiful and more save ? If not, please use our
          site to improve your knowledge of trees and understand what benefits
          we can do to improve the environment.
