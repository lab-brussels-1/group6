        Trees are one of the most beautiful plants on our planet. Since the
        beginning, trees have furnished us with two of life’s essentials, food
        and oxygen. As we evolved, they provided additional necessities such as
        shelter, medicine, and tools. Today, their value continues to increase
        and more benefits of trees are being discovered as their role expands to
        satisfy the needs created by our modern lifestyles.Can you imagine how
        many trees surround us, how many benefits they bring to us.A study in
        the journal of ‘Nature’ reported close to 3.04 Trillion trees on earth.
        And though this might seem like a lot- it’s not! 3.04 Trillion trees
        make for almost 422 trees per person.The largest forest in the world
        exists far to the north amongst a less bountiful ecosystem. The Great
        Boreal Forests span the Arctic circle in Canada, Russia, and
        Scandinavia. These forests contain approximately 750 billion trees,
        nearly ¼ of the world’s total.Forests are very important to the
        environment because they use carbon dioxide (CO2) and produce oxygen.
        They also provide shelter and food for many different types of plants
        and animals..
        <br />
        <br />
        But we also have negative aspects like cutting down trees is called
        deforestation and it can have serious effects. If animals’ homes, which
        are built in and around the trees, are destroyed, many species will
        become extinct. For example, many different types of animals in South
        America were lost before scientists could learn about them.
        Deforestation also affects the climate. When rain falls on a forest, new
        clouds are created. If huge areas of trees are cut down, clouds do not
        form, rain does not fall and the land becomes drier. The CO2 builds up
        and adds to the global warming which is making the Earth become hotter.
        <br />
        <br />
        Many European countries are planting trees faster than they are cutting
        them down. Many trees were planted a few years ago to replace woodland
        and to create forests in areas where there wasn’t much wood. Have you
        thought about what we can do to make our forests and parks even more
        beautiful and more save ? If not, please use our site to improve your
        knowledge of trees and understand what benefits we can do to improve the
        environment.
